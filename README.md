# ADCS-ESC-Vuln-Research
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a Microsoft service that provides a customizable platform for issuing and managing public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates. These certificates are used to secure communication, authenticate users and devices, and ensure data integrity across a network. AD CS allows organizations to create their own certificate authorities (CAs), which can issue and manage certificates for internal or external use. The service integrates with Active Directory, making it easier to deploy and manage certificates within a Windows environment. AD CS also supports various certificate enrollment methods, including manual and automated processes.

Enterprise Security Certificate (ESC) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a network's Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) configurations to grant unauthorized access or other privileges within the same environment. Such attacks exploit misconfigurations, poor certificate templates, or incorrect access controls that let attackers issue rogue certs to impersonate privileged users. ESCs greatly depend on AD CS as this is responsible for overall management of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and hence an easy target for attackers looking to hack into enterprise security.

**This repository focuses each ESC vulnerability in terms of the misconfiguration, red team approach, blue team approach, mitigation techniques and planning for disaster scenarios.**

# ADCS-ESC-Vuln-Research
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a Microsoft service that provides a customizable platform for issuing and managing public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates. These certificates are used to secure communication, authenticate users and devices, and ensure data integrity across a network. AD CS allows organizations to create their own certificate authorities (CAs), which can issue and manage certificates for internal or external use. The service integrates with Active Directory, making it easier to deploy and manage certificates within a Windows environment. AD CS also supports various certificate enrollment methods, including manual and automated processes.

This repository focusses on techniques and tools for (ESC) vulnerabilities in Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) with Red Team and Blue Team perspectives. This repository will guide for each ESC vulnerability in terms of the misconfiguration, red team approach, blue team approach, and mitigation techniques.
